** Cordova (please talk to Greg and Chhing about this before starting anything to do with Cordova)
- You will need to install NPM and [Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/5.0.0/guide_overview_index.md.html#Overview)
- You will need XCode and Android SDK to build the app ("cordova build" - but you don't strictly need to if you just want to write code)
- Install a platform with "cordova platform add android"
- To test/debug the app you need to serve it ("cordova serve") and then navigate to http://localhost... etc.
- To test the app on the emulator itself you will need to "cordova emulate ios" / "cordova emulate android"
